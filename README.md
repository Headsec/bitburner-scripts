# Bitburner Scripts

Early-game friendly Bitburner scripts focused on readable automation (rooting + basic weaken/grow/hack loops).

## Contents
- `wg.js` — weaken/grow loop to prep a target
- `wgh.js` — weaken/grow/hack loop for basic money
- `nuke.js` — scan from `home`, use available port openers, run `NUKE.exe`, print a summary
